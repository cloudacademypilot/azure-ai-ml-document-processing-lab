## W-2 model

The W-2 form model extracts key information reported in each box on a W-2 form. The model supports standard and customized forms from 2018 to the present, including single and multiple forms on one page.

### What is a W-2 form?

Form W-2, also known as the Wage and Tax Statement, is sent by an employer to each employee and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) at the end of the year. A W-2 form reports employees' annual wages and the amount of taxes withheld from their paychecks. The IRS also uses W-2 forms to track individuals' tax obligations. The Social Security Administration (SSA) uses the information on this and other forms to compute the Social Security benefits for all workers.
